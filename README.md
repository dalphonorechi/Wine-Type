# Predicting Type of Wine: RED or WHITE

This project is to predict the type of wine, red or white, using the following attributes:

* Fixed acidity. The predominant fixed acids in wine, such as tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic acids.
* Volatile acidity. The high acetic acid present in wine, which causes an unpleasant vinegar taste.
* Citric acid. A weak organic acid used to increase the freshness and flavor of wine.
* Residual sugar. The amount of sugar left after fermentation.
* Chlorides. The amount of salt in wine.
* Free sulfur dioxide. SO2 is used for preventing wine from oxidation and microbial spoilage.
* Total sulfur dioxide. The amount of free and bound forms of SO2.
* Density. Depends on the alcohol and sugar content.
* pH. Used to check the level of acidity or alkalinity of wine.
* Sulfates. An antibacterial and antioxidant agent added to wine.
* Alcohol. The percentage of alcohol in wine.
